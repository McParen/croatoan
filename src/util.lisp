The key can be a printable character, a control character or a function key.

In particular:

- A printable character becomes a string containing that character (e.g. #\a -> \"a\");

- A control character becomes a string with the (upcased) character prefixed with the caret character (#\^).
  (e.g Control-j -> \"^J\")

- A keyword becomes a string.
  Note that the key names returned by ncurses in general do not correspond to the key names used by croatoan.

  KEY_F(1) vs F1
  kLFT5    vs CTRL-LEFT
